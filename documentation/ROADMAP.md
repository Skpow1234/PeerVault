# PeerVault Roadmap

This roadmap organizes improvements by priority and theme. It reflects issues and opportunities identified across the codebase (`internal/app/fileserver`, `internal/transport/p2p`, `internal/storage`, `internal/crypto`, `cmd/peervault`).

## Guiding goals

- Correctness across nodes (consistent addressing and file discovery)
- Secure by default (authenticated encryption, authenticated transport)
- Robust transport (proper framing, no sleeps, backpressure)
- Efficient streaming (no unnecessary buffering)
- Operable and testable (observability, race-safety, e2e tests)
- Developer experience and portability (Windows-safe paths, simple run)

---

## Milestone 1 — Correctness and Security (P0) ✅

1 Fix ID scoping mismatch (cross-node fetch/store) ✅

- Problem: files are written/read under `id/key`, but `GetFile`/`StoreFile` use requester/sender `ID`, causing misses.
- Options:
  - A) Remove `ID` from on-disk path entirely and store by `hashedKey` only.
  - B) Use a stable owner/cluster scope (not the requester) when storing/serving.
- Acceptance: A node that does not have a file locally can fetch it from a peer successfully.
- Touchpoints: `internal/app/fileserver/server.go`, `internal/storage/store.go`.

2 Replace AES-CTR with authenticated encryption (AEAD) ✅

- Problem: AES-CTR without authentication is malleable and offers no integrity.
- Solution: AES-GCM (preferred) or ChaCha20-Poly1305 with 12-byte nonce and AAD including message type/size.
- Update APIs: `CopyEncrypt`/`CopyDecrypt` to use AEAD; prepend nonce and auth tag; verify on decrypt.
- Acceptance: Crypto unit tests pass; tampering is detected; e2e still streams.
- Touchpoints: `internal/crypto/crypto.go`, `crypto_test.go`, call sites in `fileserver`.

3 Replace MD5/SHA-1 with SHA-256 (or HMAC-SHA-256 for hidden logical keys) ✅

- `HashKey` → SHA-256 (or HMAC with cluster secret if keys must be concealed).
- CAS path transform → SHA-256, adapt block size segmentation.
- Acceptance: Existing tests updated; new expected paths validated.
- Touchpoints: `internal/crypto/crypto.go`, `internal/storage/store.go`, tests.

4 Key management model ✅

- Current: Each node generates a random `EncKey`, but peers need the same key to decrypt replicated streams.
- Choose:
  - A) Shared cluster key loaded from env/config for demo.
  - B) Per-file keys derived from a KDF and exchanged via handshake.
  - C) Per-connection session keys (handshake), encrypt-in-transit only, plaintext at rest (or vice versa).
- Start with A) for demo simplicity; document B/C as next steps.
- Touchpoints: `cmd/peervault/main.go`, config, handshake.

5 Add authenticated transport handshake ✅

- Implement handshake exchanging node identities and (for demo) verifying a pre-shared auth token or using Noise IK/XX.
- Produce a `PeerInfo {NodeID, PubKey}` and store in peer map.
- Acceptance: Only authenticated peers join; unauthenticated peers are rejected with clear logs.
- Touchpoints: `internal/transport/p2p/handshake.go`, `tcp_transport.go`, `fileserver.OnPeer`.

6 Message framing with length prefix ✅

- Replace ad-hoc `DefaultDecoder` with a consistent frame: `[type:u8][len:u32][payload:len]`.
- For streams, send `[IncomingStream:u8][size:u64]` then raw bytes; for messages, the payload is encoded (JSON/CBOR/protobuf/gob).
- Acceptance: Fuzz tests for Decoder; no reliance on `time.Sleep`.
- Touchpoints: `internal/transport/p2p/encoding.go`, `tcp_transport.go`, `fileserver` send/receive.

---

## Milestone 2 — Transport, Streaming, and Storage (P1) ✅

1 Remove `time.Sleep`-based coordination ✅

- Solution: Replace with proper request-response protocol using acknowledgments.
- Acceptance: No `time.Sleep` calls in protocol logic; explicit acks for all operations.
- Touchpoints: `internal/app/fileserver/server.go`, `cmd/peervault/main.go`.

- Solution: Stream directly from disk to network peers without buffering.
- Acceptance: Large files can be replicated without memory exhaustion.
- Touchpoints: `internal/app/fileserver/server.go`.

## Testing Plan ✅

Create a folder named tests, and subfolder with the different type of tests there, also, all the test that are already created, store it there, depending of there's needed
Unit tests

- Crypto: AEAD encrypt/decrypt roundtrip; tamper detection; nonce uniqueness.
- Storage: CAS path transform updates; read/write/delete happy/edge paths.
- Transport: decoder framing tests; fuzz `Decode` for partial reads.

Integration tests

- End-to-end replication: A stores; B fetches from network; validate bytes and size.
- Large file streaming (e.g., 100MB) within time/memory bounds.
- Disconnect mid-stream and ensure proper cleanup; subsequent retries succeed.
- Auth handshake: unauthenticated peer rejected; authenticated accepted.

Tooling

- Race detector: `go test -race ./...`
- Fuzzing for decoder: `go test -run ^$ -fuzz=Fuzz -fuzztime=30s ./internal/transport/p2p`

---

## Implementation Notes (by area)

### API Design and Schema

GraphQL Schema (`internal/api/graphql/schema/`)

- **File Operations**: `File`, `FileMetadata`, `FileUpload`, `FileDownload` types with mutations and queries
- **Peer Management**: `Peer`, `PeerNetwork`, `PeerHealth` types for network topology and health monitoring
- **System Monitoring**: `SystemMetrics`, `PerformanceStats`, `StorageStats` for real-time monitoring
- **Subscriptions**: Real-time updates for file operations, peer status changes, and system events
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control

REST API (`internal/api/rest/`)

- **File Endpoints**: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/files/{key}` for basic file operations
- **Peer Endpoints**: `GET /api/v1/peers`, `GET /api/v1/peers/{id}/health` for peer management
- **System Endpoints**: `GET /api/v1/health`, `GET /api/v1/metrics` for system status
- **Webhooks**: `POST /api/v1/webhooks` for event notifications and integrations

gRPC API (`internal/api/grpc/`)

- **File Service**: Streaming file upload/download, metadata operations
- **Peer Service**: Peer discovery, health monitoring, network management
- **System Service**: Metrics collection, configuration management
- **Streaming**: Bidirectional streaming for real-time operations

### Fileserver (`internal/app/fileserver/server.go`)

- Remove `time.Sleep`; wait for explicit acks or use size headers.
- Guard `peers` with `RWMutex`; add helper methods to broadcast safely.
- Rework `Store` to stream: `tee := io.TeeReader(r, localWriter)` and `io.Copy` into an `io.MultiWriter` over peers via an AEAD-wrapped writer.
- Align ID/path usage with new storage layout.

Transport (`internal/transport/p2p`)

- `encoding.go`: implement length-prefixed framing and robust reads.
- `handshake.go`: define `PeerInfo`, perform authentication (PSK demo; Noise later).
- `tcp_transport.go`: on stream header, block for size; remove reliance on goroutine `wg` coordination via magic control bytes.

Storage (`internal/storage`)

- Switch to SHA-256; update block segmentation size and tests.
- Consider removing `ID` from on-disk layout; store by `hashedKey` only, or store under `ownerID` not `requesterID`.

Crypto (`internal/crypto`)

- Implement AEAD helpers with nonce management, AAD, and constant-time checks.
- Replace MD5 with SHA-256/HMAC-SHA-256; provide `HashKey()` and `HashKeyHMAC(secret, key)`.

Entrypoint (`cmd/peervault/main.go`)

- Provide config/env for a cluster key (demo); sanitize `StorageRoot` for Windows.
- Optionally split nodes into separate processes for more realistic demos.

---

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Cross-node fetch works consistently with new storage scoping
- [ ] AEAD enforced; tampering detected; unit tests cover crypto edge cases
- [ ] No `time.Sleep` for protocol timing; framed messages/streams only
- [ ] Decoder tolerant to partial reads; fuzz tests pass
- [ ] No data races (race detector clean); `peers` access synchronized
- [ ] SHA-256/HMAC adopted; CAS tests updated
- [ ] Windows path safe by default
- [ ] Structured logs with peer IDs and error wrapping
- [ ] Example e2e tests for store/get/replication/large files
