- 🔒 **Container Security**: Trivy vulnerability scanning
- 🔒 **Security Integration Tests**: RBAC, audit, privacy, PKI testing
- 🔒 **Custom Security Tools**: PeerVault-specific security scanning

**Triggers**:

- Push to `main`/`develop` branches
- Pull requests
- Daily schedule (2 AM UTC)
- Manual dispatch

### 2. Development Security Checks (`security-dev.yml`)

**Purpose**: Quick security validation for development changes

**Features**:

- 🔒 **Security Module Testing**: Compilation and functionality testing
- 🔒 **Security Unit Tests**: RBAC, audit, privacy, PKI tests
- 🔒 **Security Tools Testing**: Custom security tools validation
