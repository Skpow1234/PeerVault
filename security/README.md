## Security Features

### 1. Security Auditing

- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Compliance checking
- Security policy enforcement
- Audit trail generation

### 2. Access Control

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Access control lists (ACLs)
- Permission management
- Authorization policies

### 3. Data Privacy

- Data classification
- Privacy controls
- Data retention policies
- Compliance reporting

### 4. Certificate Management

- PKI infrastructure
- Certificate lifecycle management
- Certificate rotation
- Security compliance

## Usage

### Running Security Scans

```bash
# Run comprehensive security scan
./security/tools/security-scan.sh

# Run penetration tests
./security/tools/penetration-test.sh

# Check compliance
./security/tools/compliance-check.sh
```

### Security Configuration

Security policies are configured in YAML files in the `policies/` directory. These can be customized based on organizational requirements.

## Compliance

PeerVault security features support compliance with:

- SOC 2 Type II
- ISO 27001
- GDPR
- HIPAA
- PCI DSS

## Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Audits**: Run security scans regularly
2. **Access Control**: Implement least privilege access
3. **Data Classification**: Classify all data appropriately
4. **Certificate Management**: Rotate certificates regularly
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor security events continuously
6. **Incident Response**: Have incident response procedures in place

## Reporting Issues

Security issues should be reported through the appropriate channels:

- Critical vulnerabilities: Immediate notification
- Security bugs: Standard bug reporting process
- Compliance issues: Compliance team notification

## Contributing

When contributing to security features:

1. Follow security coding practices
2. Include security tests
3. Update security documentation
4. Review security implications
5. Follow the principle of least privilege
