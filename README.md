# PeerVault — P2P encrypted file store (Go)

Lightweight peer-to-peer file store demo written in Go. Nodes communicate over TCP, replicate files across peers, and encrypt file transfers using AES-CTR.

The included entrypoint at `cmd/peervault/main.go` boots 3 nodes locally and runs a simple store/get flow to demonstrate replication.

## Features

- Encrypted file streaming over TCP (AES-GCM with authentication)
- Advanced key management with derivation and rotation
- Authenticated peer connections with HMAC-SHA256 signatures
- Length-prefixed message framing for reliable transport
- Simple P2P transport abstraction (`internal/transport/p2p`)
- Content-addressable storage layout (SHA-256 based path transform)
- **GraphQL API** for flexible queries, mutations, and real-time subscriptions
- **REST API** for simple CRUD operations and webhook integrations
- **Interactive GraphQL Playground** for testing and development
- **Swagger UI** for REST API documentation and testing
- **Real-time monitoring** with health checks and metrics
- Minimal example that launches 3 local nodes and exchanges files

## Message Framing

The system uses a robust length-prefixed framing protocol for reliable message transport:

- **Frame Format**: `[type:u8][len:u32][payload:len]`
- **Message Types**:
  - `0x1`: Regular message (with payload)
  - `0x2`: Stream header (no payload)
- **Maximum Frame Size**: 1MB per frame
- **Network Resilience**: Handles partial reads and network interruptions

### Frame Structure

```bash
[Message Frame]
┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────────┐
│ Type    │ Length  │ Payload     │
│ (1 byte)│ (4 bytes)│ (N bytes)  │
└─────────┴─────────┴─────────────┘

[Stream Frame]
┌─────────┬─────────┐
│ Type    │ Length  │
│ (1 byte)│ (4 bytes)│
└─────────┴─────────┘
```

This framing ensures reliable message delivery and eliminates the need for `time.Sleep` coordination.

## Key Management

The system now supports advanced key management with the following features:

- **Key Derivation**: Encryption keys are derived from a cluster key using HMAC-SHA256
- **Key Rotation**: Keys can be rotated automatically (every 24 hours by default)
- **Environment Configuration**: Set `PEERVAULT_CLUSTER_KEY` environment variable for shared cluster keys

### Using a Shared Cluster Key

For production deployments, set a shared cluster key across all nodes:

```bash
# Set the cluster key (32-byte hex string)
export PEERVAULT_CLUSTER_KEY="a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456"

# Run the application
go run ./cmd/peervault
```

If no cluster key is provided, each node generates its own key (suitable for development/testing).

## Authentication

The system now supports authenticated peer connections with the following features:

- **Peer Authentication**: All peer connections are authenticated using HMAC-SHA256 signatures
- **Node Identity**: Each node has a unique ID that's verified during handshake
- **Timestamp Validation**: Handshake messages include timestamps to prevent replay attacks
- **Environment Configuration**: Set `PEERVAULT_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable for shared authentication

### Using Authentication

For production deployments, set a shared auth token across all nodes:

```bash
# Set the auth token
export PEERVAULT_AUTH_TOKEN="your-secure-auth-token-here"

# Run the application
go run ./cmd/peervault
```

If no auth token is provided, a default demo token is used (suitable for development/testing).

## Requirements

- Go 1.24.4+ (required for security fixes)
- Make (optional; for Unix-like systems)

## Security

### Vulnerability Fixes

This project includes fixes for the following security vulnerabilities:

#### GO-2025-3750: Inconsistent handling of O_CREATE|O_EXCL on Unix and Windows

**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**Go Version:** 1.24.4+  
**Impact:** Race conditions in file creation, potential security bypasses

**Fix Applied:**

- Updated to Go 1.24.4+ (minimum required version)
- Implemented atomic file creation with `O_CREATE|O_EXCL` flags
- Added proper error handling for file existence checks

**Files Modified:**

- `internal/storage/store.go` - Added `createFileAtomic()` function
- `go.mod` - Updated to Go 1.24.4
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Updated CI to use Go 1.24.4

### Security Scanning

The CI pipeline includes automated security scanning:

- **govulncheck** - Scans for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **gosec** - Static analysis for security issues
- **Dependabot** - Automated dependency updates with security patches

## Windows Defender Setup

If you're developing on Windows, you may encounter Windows Defender popups when running the application or tests. This is because Go applications that create network connections and access the file system are often flagged as potentially suspicious.

### Quick Fix (Recommended)

Run the quick trust script as Administrator:

```cmd
# Right-click and "Run as Administrator"
scripts\quick_trust.bat
```

### Full Setup (Advanced)

For a complete setup with code signing, run the PowerShell script as Administrator:

```powershell
# Right-click PowerShell and "Run as Administrator"
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
.\scripts\trust_application.ps1
```

This will:

- Add Windows Defender exclusions for the project folder
- Create a self-signed certificate for code signing
- Set up a build script that signs your binaries
- Configure your PowerShell profile for development

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to do it manually:

1. Open **Windows Security**
2. Go to **Virus & threat protection**
3. Click **Manage settings**
4. Under **Exclusions**, add:
   - Folder: Your project directory
   - Process: `peervault.exe`, `peervault-node.exe`, `peervault-demo.exe`, `go.exe`

### Why This Happens

Windows Defender flags Go applications because they:

- Create network connections (P2P networking)
- Access the file system (storage operations)
- Generate random data (crypto operations)
- Are compiled from source (not signed by trusted publishers)

This is normal for development and doesn't indicate any security issues.

## Install

```bash
# Clone your copy of this repository and change into it
git clone https://github.com/Skpow1234/PeerVault
cd peervault
go mod download
```

## Build

### Linux/macOS

```bash
make build
# binary at ./bin/peervault

# Build GraphQL server
go build -o bin/peervault-graphql ./cmd/peervault-graphql

# Build REST API server
go build -o bin/peervault-api ./cmd/peervault-api
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
go build -o bin\peervault.exe .\cmd\peervault

# Build GraphQL server
go build -o bin\peervault-graphql.exe .\cmd\peervault-graphql
```

## Run

This repository’s `main.go` starts 3 nodes on localhost: `:3000`, `:7000`, `:5000`, then stores and fetches sample files via the third node.

### Easiest: go run

```bash
go run ./cmd/peervault
```

### Linux/macOS with Make

```bash
make run
```

### Windows

- If you built with `go build -o bin\peervault.exe .\cmd\peervault`:

```powershell
.\bin\peervault.exe
```

### What you should see

- Logs for each node starting up and connecting
- 20 demo files being stored and fetched
- Output lines like:

  - `[::]:5000 starting fileserver...`
  - `received and written (...) bytes to disk`
  - `my big data file here!`

#### Important note for Windows users

By default, each node’s storage root is set to the listen address plus `_network` (for example `":3000_network"`). The colon `:` is not a valid character in Windows directory names, which can cause errors when creating folders.

Two simple options:

- Recommended: Run via WSL or Git Bash (Unix-like environment), or
- Update `main.go` to use a Windows-friendly storage root. For example, change the `StorageRoot` in `makeServer` to something like:

```go
StorageRoot: fmt.Sprintf("node%s_network", strings.TrimPrefix(listenAddr, ":")),
```

or even hardcode per node (e.g., `"node3000_network"`, `"node7000_network"`, `"node5000_network"`).

File to edit: `cmd/peervault/main.go`, function `makeServer`.

## GraphQL API

PeerVault includes a comprehensive GraphQL API for interacting with the distributed storage system.

## gRPC API

PeerVault includes a high-performance gRPC API for streaming operations and service-to-service communication, built with Protocol Buffers and designed for high-throughput applications.

### Architecture grpc

The gRPC API follows a service-oriented architecture:

```bash
internal/api/grpc/
├── types/            # Type definitions (temporary, will be replaced by protobuf)
│   └── types.go      # Basic type definitions
├── services/         # Service implementations
│   ├── file_service.go
│   ├── peer_service.go
│   └── system_service.go
├── server.go         # Main gRPC server
└── proto/            # Protocol Buffer definitions
    └── peervault.proto
```

### Running the gRPC API Server

```bash
# Build and run the gRPC API server
go build -o peervault-grpc.exe ./cmd/peervault-grpc
./peervault-grpc.exe

# Or run directly
go run ./cmd/peervault-grpc

# Run with custom configuration
go run ./cmd/peervault-grpc -port 8082 -auth-token your-secure-token
```

### gRPC API Features

- ✅ **HTTP/JSON API**: Working server with JSON endpoints (temporary solution)
- ✅ **Health checks**: `/health` endpoint with system status
- ✅ **System information**: `/system/info` endpoint with version and metrics
- ✅ **Metrics**: `/system/metrics` endpoint with performance data
- ✅ **File operations**: `/files` endpoints for file management
- ✅ **Peer management**: `/peers` endpoints for peer operations
- 🔄 **Bidirectional Streaming**: Real-time file upload/download with chunked transfer (planned)
- 🔄 **Service Discovery**: Built-in service discovery and load balancing support (planned)
- 🔄 **High Throughput**: Optimized for high-performance applications (planned)
- 🔄 **Type Safety**: Strongly typed with protobuf definitions (planned)
- 🔄 **Authentication**: Token-based authentication with metadata (planned)
- 🔄 **Event Streaming**: Real-time events for file operations, peer status, and system metrics (planned)

### gRPC Services

- **File Operations**: Streaming upload/download, metadata management
- **Peer Operations**: Peer discovery, health monitoring, network management
- **System Operations**: Metrics collection, health checks, system information
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time events for monitoring and notifications

### Example Usage

```go
// Connect to gRPC server
conn, err := grpc.Dial("localhost:8082", grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials()))
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer conn.Close()

client := pb.NewPeerVaultServiceClient(conn)

// Health check
response, err := client.HealthCheck(context.Background(), &pb.Empty{})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Printf("Status: %s\n", response.Status)
```

### gRPC API Benefits

- **High Performance**: Optimized for low-latency, high-throughput operations
- **Streaming Support**: Efficient handling of large file transfers
- **Type Safety**: Strongly typed with Protocol Buffers
- **Multi-language Support**: Client libraries available for multiple languages
- **Service Discovery**: Built-in service discovery capabilities
- **Real-time Events**: Streaming events for monitoring and notifications

For complete gRPC API documentation, see [docs/grpc/README.md](docs/grpc/README.md).

## gRPC Implementation Status

### ✅ **Completed**

- **HTTP/JSON Server**: Working server with JSON endpoints
- **Health Endpoints**: `/health`, `/system/info`, `/system/metrics`
- **File Operations**: `/files` endpoints for file management
- **Peer Operations**: `/peers` endpoints for peer management
- **Event Broadcasting**: Background event generation for testing
- **Service Layer**: Complete service implementations for file, peer, and system operations

### 🔄 **In Progress**

- **Full protobuf generation**: The protobuf Go code generation is currently using a manual implementation. The next step is to properly install and configure `protoc` to generate the complete Go code from the `.proto` files.
- **True gRPC implementation**: Currently using HTTP/JSON endpoints as a temporary solution. Will be replaced with proper gRPC streaming once protobuf generation is working.

### 📋 **Next Steps**

1. **Install protoc compiler**: Set up proper protobuf compilation environment
2. **Generate protobuf code**: Use `protoc` to generate proper Go code from `.proto` files
3. **Implement true gRPC**: Replace HTTP/JSON with actual gRPC streaming
4. **Add streaming endpoints**: Implement bidirectional streaming for file operations
5. **Add authentication**: Implement proper gRPC authentication and authorization

### 🚨 **Current Limitations**

- The server uses HTTP/JSON instead of true gRPC due to protobuf marshaling issues
- Streaming functionality is simulated with background event generation
- Authentication is currently disabled for development purposes

The Swagger documentation includes:

- Detailed endpoint descriptions with examples
- Request/response schemas for all data types
- Authentication and security information
- Error handling documentation
- Rate limiting details

## Docker

PeerVault supports multiple containerization approaches:

### All-in-One Container (Development)

Build and run the demo in a single container:

```bash
docker build -t peervault .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -p 5000:5000 -p 7000:7000 peervault
```

### Multi-Container Deployment (Production)

For production-like environments with separate containers:

```bash
# Build and run all services
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build

# Run in background
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down
```

### Development Setup

For development and testing:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

### Individual Nodes

Run individual nodes for custom topologies:

```bash
# Build node image
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.node -t peervault-node .

# Run bootstrap node
docker run -d --name node1 -p 3000:3000 peervault-node --listen :3000

# Run client node
docker run -d --name node2 -p 5000:5000 peervault-node \
  --listen :5000 --bootstrap node1:3000
```

For detailed containerization documentation, see [documentation/CONTAINERIZATION.md](documentation/CONTAINERIZATION.md).

## How it works (high level)

- `cmd/peervault/main.go` creates 3 servers and bootstraps them together using the TCP transport in `internal/transport/p2p`.
- Files are written to disk under a content-addressed path derived from a SHA-1 of the key (`CASPathTransformFunc` in `internal/storage`).
- On store:
  - The file is written locally.
  - A control message is broadcast to peers so they can pull the encrypted stream and persist it.
- On get:
  - If not present locally, a request is broadcast and another peer streams the file back.
- Network messages are framed by a minimal protocol in `internal/transport/p2p` with small control bytes to distinguish messages vs. streams.
- **GraphQL API**: The `cmd/peervault-graphql` binary provides a GraphQL interface for querying files, monitoring peers, and accessing system metrics through HTTP endpoints.

### CI Pipeline Checks

The CI pipeline automatically runs these checks on every push and pull request:

#### **Critical Checks** (Pipeline fails if these fail)

- **Unit Tests**: `go test -v -race ./tests/unit/...` and `go test -v -race ./internal/...`
- **Fuzz Tests**: `go test -fuzz=Fuzz -fuzztime=30s ./tests/fuzz/...`
- **Security Scanning**: `gosec` and `govulncheck`
- **Build Tests**: Cross-platform binary builds
- **Docker Tests**: Container builds and validation

#### **Non-Critical Checks** (Pipeline passes with warnings)

- **Integration Tests**: `go test -v -timeout=10m ./tests/integration/...` (shows warnings if failed - these are application logic bugs)
- **Linting**: `golangci-lint run ./...` (shows warnings if failed)
- **Code Formatting**: `gofmt -s -l .` (shows warnings if code is not formatted)
- **Trailing Whitespace**: Checks for trailing spaces in code files (Go, YAML, YML) - excludes markdown files
- **Code Quality**: Cyclomatic complexity and import checks
- **Documentation**: Exported function comments and README checks

**Pro tip**: Run the pre-commit script before pushing to keep code clean!

```bash
# Unix/Linux/macOS
./scripts/pre-commit.sh

# Windows PowerShell
.\scripts\pre-commit.ps1

# Or run individual commands:
go fmt ./...
goimports -w .
golangci-lint run ./...
```

**Note**: Lint and format failures won't block the pipeline, but it's good practice to keep code clean!

## Clean up local data

The demo writes files under a per-node storage root. To remove all data, delete the created folders (e.g., `ggnetwork` or the per-node roots you configured), or call `Store.Clear()` from your own code.

## Customize / next steps

- Turn the example into a long-running daemon and add a CLI/API
- Add proper peer discovery and resilient replication
- Replace demo logic in `main.go` with your own application code
- **GraphQL API**: Use the GraphQL API for building web applications and integrations
- **REST API**: Use the REST API for simple operations and webhook integrations
- **Real-time monitoring**: Leverage GraphQL subscriptions for real-time system monitoring
- **API extensions**: Extend the GraphQL schema with custom types and resolvers
